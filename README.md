## Getting Started

Upcoming reservation app with some filters to make easier for them to search customers.
Restaurant owners are one of our servicesâ€™ users. To help them manage their business better,
I have built an interface to display upcoming reservations, so that they can take action on them.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add
  ```

### Installation

Following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purpose.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zubairbaig212/yassir_frontend_coding_challenge
   ```
2. Install YARN packages
   ```sh
   yarn add
   ```
3. Start project by running following commands

```sh
yarn start
```

4. Now, you need to start your Json server by command

   ```sh
   yarn json-server -w -p 3500 mock_data/db.json
   ```

## Usage

1. Install following on your local machine

   $ git clone https://github.com/zubairbaig212/yassir_frontend_coding_challenge
   ```
3. Start project by running following commands

   # `After cloning the project, you then need to install packages by following command`

   ### `yarn install`

   once node_modules gets installed, you need to run next command

   ### `yarn start`

4. Once your app is running, you can access it on the following address in your browser

   - Now, you need to start your Json server by command

   ### `yarn json-server -w -p 3500 mock_data/db.json`
